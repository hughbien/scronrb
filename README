DESCRIPTION
===========

Scron is a script built on top of cron for running commands at scheduled
intervals.  This works well with laptops which may be shut off at exact times
when a cron task is scheduled.

INSTALLATION
============

  % mv scron.rb /directory/in/path/scron

Then configure cron to run it (every 2 hours):

  % crontab -e
  0 */2 * * * scron

USAGE
=====

Set tasks in $HOME/.scron:

  30d cmd arg1 arg2
  7d /path/to/script.rb
  24h /path/to/script2.rb

CONFIGURE
=========

Some environment variables you can set in your bashrc or zshrc:

  SCRONLOG=~/.scronlog
  SCRONDB=~/.scrondb

SCRONLOG is where stdout/errors from your commands are recorded.  By default,
any output is not recorded.

SCRONDB is where scron holds the timestamps of the last run commands so it
knows when enough time has elapsed to re-run a command.

An exit status of 0 is considered a success.  Anything else is considered a
failure and scron will attempt to re-run it again in 2 hours (or whatever you
configure the scron.
