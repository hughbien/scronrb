DESCRIPTION
===========

Scron is a scheduler for laptops/machines which aren't on 24/7.

INSTALLATION
============

  % mv scron.rb /directory/in/path/scron

Then configure cron to run it.  I recommend every 2 hours, but you can put any
interval here:

  % crontab -e
  0 */2 * * * scron

USAGE
=====

Configure jobs in $HOME/.scron. This example means run `cmd arg1 arg2` at least
once every 30 days:

  30d cmd arg1 arg2

You can also specify lower bounds like day of week (Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa),
day of month (23rd), or day of year (4/15):

  Mo   cmd1
  23rd cmd2
  4/15 cmd3

`cmd1` will attempt to run on Monday.  If your machine is off the entire day, it
will run it on the following day.

NOTES
=====

An exit status of 0 is considered a success.  Anything else is considered a
failure and scron will attempt to re-run it again in 2 hours.

$HOME/.scrondb keeps the timestamps of the last run commands.

$HOME/.scronlog has the stdout, timestamps, and exit status of last 
scheduled commands.
